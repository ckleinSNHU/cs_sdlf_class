# CS-255-16514-M01 System Analysis and Design 2025 C-1 (Jan - Mar)

This repository contains the work for the CS-255 System Analysis and Design course, section 16514-M01, during the Winter 2025 term (January - March).

## Course Description
Students will explore the principles, methods, and techniques used in systems development so that they can create system models using appropriate industry tools. As a part of creating system models, students will also learn to effectively communicate technical concepts and design decisions to various audiences in a professional manner.

## DriverPass Project

This project involved designing a system called DriverPass for a hypothetical driving school. The system aimed to streamline the process of scheduling driving tests, managing student information, and tracking test results.

**Strengths:** I believe I was particularly effective in creating clear and comprehensive UML diagrams, especially the use case diagram, which effectively captured the interactions between different actors and the system.

**Areas for Revision:** If I were to revise one aspect, I would focus on providing more detailed descriptions of the system's database design in the system design document. This would enhance the technical clarity of the document.

**User Needs:** I incorporated user needs by not only focusing on the functional requirements but also on the overall user experience. For example, I designed the interface to be intuitive and easy to navigate, ensuring that users could easily find the information they needed. I also considered the needs of users with disabilities by adhering to accessibility guidelines. To gather user feedback, I conducted hypothetical usability testing with friends and family, which revealed the need for a more prominent search function. This feedback led me to redesign the interface to make the search bar more accessible.

**Design Approach:** I utilized a user-centered design approach, focusing on understanding the needs and pain points of the users before creating the system design. In the future, I would also explore incorporating agile methodologies to allow for more flexibility and iterative development.
